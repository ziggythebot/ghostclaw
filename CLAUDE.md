# GhostClaw

Personal AI assistant. Originally forked from [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw), now fully independent with its own architecture.

## Quick Context

Single Node.js process that connects to Telegram, routes messages to Claude Agent SDK running as **direct Node.js child processes** (no containers). Each group has isolated filesystem and memory.

Agents run directly on the host machine. `container-runner.ts` spawns `node` processes, passing paths via environment variables (`GHOSTCLAW_GROUP_DIR`, `GHOSTCLAW_IPC_DIR`, `GHOSTCLAW_GLOBAL_DIR`).

## Community

[GhostClaw community on Telegram](https://t.me/+8qJbqxzBQAZkYTNk) — for problems, suggestions, and sharing.

## Dashboard (Mission Control)

Built-in web UI at `http://localhost:3333`. Token auto-generated in `.env` on first run. Tabs: Status, Chats, Tasks, Souls, Logs, Research. SSE for real-time updates. Source: `src/dashboard.ts` + `container/dashboard.html`.

## Development

Run commands directly — don't tell the user to run them.

```bash
npm run dev          # Run with hot reload
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
npm run test         # Run tests
```

Service management:
```bash
# macOS (launchd)
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ghostclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ghostclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.ghostclaw  # restart

# Linux (systemd)
systemctl --user start ghostclaw
systemctl --user stop ghostclaw
systemctl --user restart ghostclaw
```

## Agent Environment Model

Agents run as child processes with the **real HOME**. Session isolation uses `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — **never override HOME**.

- `container-runner.ts` sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=data/sessions/{group}/.claude` for per-group session isolation. The Claude Agent SDK reads this natively.
- `HOME` is inherited from the host process. Tools like `gh`, Gmail OAuth, and any MCP server find their credentials at `~/` as expected.
- The MCP SDK automatically passes `HOME`, `PATH`, `USER`, `SHELL`, `TERM`, `LOGNAME` to MCP server processes (safe allowlist). Custom vars must be passed explicitly.

### Adding MCP servers

Use the **standard Claude Code pattern**: add to `data/sessions/{group}/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["my-mcp-package"]
    }
  }
}
```

The agent-runner reads `mcpServers` from settings.json at startup and merges them with the built-in `ghostclaw` IPC server. `allowedTools` is built dynamically (`mcp__{name}__*` for each server). No code changes needed.

For globally-enabled servers (available to all groups), add to `buildGlobalMcpServers()` in `container-runner.ts` — these get synced into every group's settings.json automatically. Only the `ghostclaw` server stays programmatic (needs runtime vars like `GHOSTCLAW_CHAT_JID`).

## Security

Skills are scanned before application (`skills-engine/security-scan.ts`). Critical findings block apply. Run `npx tsx scripts/scan-skill.ts --all` to scan all skills.

## NanoClaw Heritage

Originally forked from NanoClaw. The skills engine and `/update-nanoclaw` skill can still cherry-pick upstream changes, but the core architecture has diverged:
- `.ghostclaw/` state directory (was `.nanoclaw/`)
- `GHOSTCLAW_*` environment variables (was `NANOCLAW_*`)
- `mcp__ghostclaw__*` tool names (was `mcp__nanoclaw__*`)
- No containers — agents run directly on host
- Settings-based MCP server configuration

When pulling upstream updates, watch for conflicts in:
- `src/container-runner.ts` (rewritten to spawn node directly)
- `src/index.ts` (Telegram channel additions)
- `container/agent-runner/src/` (Gmail MCP, settings-based MCP merge)
