# GhostClaw

Personal AI assistant that runs bare metal on a dedicated machine. Fork of [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) with containers removed.

Your bot gets its own Telegram identity, transcribes voice notes, runs scheduled tasks, and learns how you like to communicate. No Docker, no microservices — just a Node.js process and SQLite.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziggythebot/ghostclaw.git
cd ghostclaw
npm install
```

Then open Claude Code and run `/setup-ghostclaw`. It handles authentication, channels, service setup, and personality building.

Or manually:

```bash
# 1. Configure .env (copy from .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add your Claude token, bot name, and Telegram token

# 2. Build and run
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## What it does

- **Telegram + WhatsApp** — bot gets its own Telegram identity (no trigger needed in DMs). WhatsApp for group chats. Run both or just one.
- **Voice transcription** — voice notes transcribed via OpenAI Whisper and delivered as text.
- **Scheduled tasks** — "remind me every Friday at 3pm" or "check my email every morning at 8am". Cron, interval, or one-shot.
- **Soul system** — `groups/main/CLAUDE.md` defines personality, communication style, banned patterns. Read fresh every invocation.
- **Group isolation** — each chat group gets its own folder, memory, and personality. Main channel has admin privileges.
- **Security scanning** — skills are automatically scanned for suspicious patterns before installation.
- **Heartbeat monitoring** — periodic health checks that stay silent unless something needs attention.

## Architecture

```
Telegram / WhatsApp --> SQLite --> Polling loop --> Node.js child process (Claude Agent SDK) --> Response
```

Single process. Agents run directly on the host. IPC via filesystem. No containers, no orchestration.

### Key files

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `src/index.ts` | Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation |
| `src/channels/telegram.ts` | Telegram bot via Grammy |
| `src/channels/whatsapp.ts` | WhatsApp via Baileys |
| `src/container-runner.ts` | Spawns agent as Node.js child process |
| `src/transcription.ts` | Voice transcription via Whisper |
| `src/task-scheduler.ts` | Cron and one-shot scheduled tasks |
| `src/db.ts` | SQLite (messages, groups, sessions, state) |
| `groups/*/CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory and personality |
| `skills-engine/` | Skill apply, merge, and security scanning |

## Soul

The soul lives in `groups/main/CLAUDE.md`. It tells the agent how to think, talk, and work with you specifically.

**Generate yours automatically:** paste the prompt from [soul-prompt.md](.claude/skills/setup-ghostclaw/soul-prompt.md) into Claude or ChatGPT on your main computer. It already knows you — it'll write the soul file from what it knows.

Or write it manually. Define:
- Communication style (direct, verbose, technical, casual)
- Banned patterns (no emoji, no filler, no marketing speak)
- User context (businesses, preferences, key people)
- Decision style (act vs ask, opinions vs options)

Keep it under 80 lines. Put facts in separate memory files.

## Channels

| Channel | Status | Trigger needed? |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Telegram DM | Built in | No |
| Telegram group | Built in | Yes — `@BotName` |
| WhatsApp group | Built in | Yes — `@AssistantName` |

Set `TELEGRAM_ONLY=true` in `.env` to skip WhatsApp entirely.

## Skills

GhostClaw uses NanoClaw's skill system. Skills are scanned for security issues before installation.

### Built in

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Telegram | Bot channel with own identity |
| WhatsApp | Group chat support |
| Voice transcription | Whisper-powered, both channels |

### Optional (run in Claude Code)

| Skill | What it adds |
|-------|-------------|
| `/add-heartbeat` | Periodic health checks (disk, logs, email) |
| `/add-morning-briefing` | Scheduled daily/weekly briefings |
| `/add-gmail-agent` | Gmail read/send via MCP |
| `/add-update-check` | Weekly check for GhostClaw updates |
| `/add-slack` | Slack as additional channel |
| `/add-discord` | Discord as additional channel |
| `/add-telegram-swarm` | Multi-bot agent teams in Telegram |

### Security scanning

Skills are automatically scanned before installation. The scanner checks for:
- Command injection (`exec` with interpolation)
- Remote code execution (`curl | sh`)
- Credential exfiltration
- Writes to sensitive paths
- Dangerous post-apply commands

Critical findings block installation. Run manually:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/scan-skill.ts --all
```

## Scheduled tasks

Tell the bot in natural language:

```
Every weekday at 8am, check Hacker News for AI news and send me a summary
Remind me to review PRs every Friday at 3pm
Run a health check every 30 minutes
```

Tasks support cron expressions, intervals, and one-shot scheduling.

## Running as a service

### macOS (launchd)

```bash
# /setup-ghostclaw creates this automatically
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ghostclaw.plist
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ghostclaw.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.ghostclaw  # restart
```

### Linux (systemd)

```bash
systemctl --user start ghostclaw
systemctl --user stop ghostclaw
systemctl --user restart ghostclaw
```

## Configuration

All config lives in `.env`. See `.env.example` for all options.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Yes* | Claude Max subscription token |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes* | Or use API key instead |
| `ASSISTANT_NAME` | Yes | Bot name (trigger word in groups) |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Recommended | From @BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_ONLY` | No | Set `true` to skip WhatsApp |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | For voice transcription |
| `GMAIL_MCP_ENABLED` | No | Set `1` for Gmail integration |

*One of `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required.

## Updating

GhostClaw checks for updates weekly (if you've run `/add-update-check`). It notifies but never auto-updates.

To update manually:
```bash
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline  # review what changed
git diff HEAD..origin/main           # review the code
git merge origin/main
npm run build
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.ghostclaw  # restart
```

## Pulling from upstream NanoClaw

GhostClaw is a fork. To pull NanoClaw improvements:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git  # once
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Watch for conflicts in `src/container-runner.ts` and `src/index.ts`.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- Node.js 20+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- No Docker required

## FAQ

**Why not just use NanoClaw?**

NanoClaw runs agents in Docker containers. If your machine is dedicated to the bot, containers add latency and complexity for zero security benefit. GhostClaw strips that out.

**Is this less secure?**

Yes. Agents have full host access. That's the point — don't run this on a machine with data the agent shouldn't see.

**Can I use other models?**

Set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env` for any Anthropic-compatible endpoint.

**How do I build my own skills?**

See the [NanoClaw skills architecture docs](docs/nanoclaw-architecture-final.md). GhostClaw skills follow the same format — `manifest.yaml` + `add/` + `modify/` directories.
