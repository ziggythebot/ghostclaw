description: Add a heartbeat system that periodically checks a HEARTBEAT.md checklist and only alerts the user when something needs attention. Inspired by OpenClaw's heartbeat pattern.

# Add Heartbeat

Adds a periodic heartbeat that wakes the agent on a cron schedule, runs through a checklist of cheap checks, and only messages the user if something needs attention.

## What it does

1. Creates `groups/main/HEARTBEAT.md` with a template checklist
2. Registers a scheduled task that runs the heartbeat on a cron (default: every 30 minutes)
3. The agent reads the checklist, runs each check, and stays silent if everything is fine

## Setup

### 1. Create HEARTBEAT.md (if not exists)

Check if `groups/main/HEARTBEAT.md` exists. If not, create it with this template:

```markdown
# Heartbeat Checks

Run these checks periodically. Only message the user if something needs attention.

## Checks

- [ ] **GhostClaw errors**: `tail -20 ~/nanoclaw/logs/ghostclaw.error.log` — alert if non-empty in the last hour
- [ ] **Disk space**: `df -h /` — alert if usage >80%
- [ ] **Unread emails**: Check Gmail for unread emails in the last hour — summarise if any look urgent

## Rules

- Run checks in order. If something needs attention, message the user about it.
- If everything is fine, do nothing. No "all clear" messages. Respond with `<internal>All checks passed</internal>` only.
- Keep messages short. State the problem, not the diagnosis.
- Don't repeat alerts you've already sent (check conversation history first).
```

### 2. Ask the user

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:
- How often should the heartbeat run? (Every 30 minutes / Every hour / Every 2 hours)
- Any specific checks to add? (URLs to ping, services to monitor, etc.)

Update HEARTBEAT.md with their answers.

### 3. Register the scheduled task

Write an IPC task file to register the heartbeat:

```bash
NANOCLAW_DATA_DIR="${NANOCLAW_DATA_DIR:-data}"
mkdir -p "$NANOCLAW_DATA_DIR/ipc/main/tasks"
cat > "$NANOCLAW_DATA_DIR/ipc/main/tasks/heartbeat_$(date +%s).json" << 'EOF'
{
  "type": "schedule_task",
  "prompt": "Read $NANOCLAW_GROUP_DIR/HEARTBEAT.md (or ./HEARTBEAT.md in the current directory) and run each check listed. Only message the user if something needs attention. If everything is fine, respond with <internal>All checks passed</internal> and nothing else.",
  "schedule_type": "cron",
  "schedule_value": "*/30 * * * *",
  "context_mode": "isolated"
}
EOF
```

Adjust the cron value based on the user's preference.

### 4. Verify

Wait for the next cron trigger (or manually create a test by adding a failing check to HEARTBEAT.md), then check logs:

```bash
grep -i "heartbeat\|All checks passed" ~/nanoclaw/logs/ghostclaw.log | tail -5
```

## Customisation

Users can edit HEARTBEAT.md at any time to add, remove, or modify checks. The agent reads it fresh each time. No restart needed.

Examples of checks to add:
- `curl -s https://yoursite.com -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}'` — website uptime
- `gh pr list --state open --repo yourorg/yourrepo` — open PRs
- `cat /path/to/some/log | grep ERROR | tail -5` — application errors
- Check Gmail for emails from specific senders
- Check crypto prices via API
